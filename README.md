## Overview

This project focuses on developing and experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs). It aims to explore the capabilities and applications of LLMs in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The project will eventually be deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface for users.

## Features

- Implementation of state-of-the-art LLMs
- Fine-tuning models on specific datasets
- Evaluation and comparison of different models
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit (to be added)
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials (to be added)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Vis1/Large-Language-Models.git
cd Large-Language-Models
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Models

Currently, the project is under development. You can run the existing scripts for model training and evaluation:

```bash
python train_model.py --config config.yaml
python evaluate_model.py --model_path path/to/model
```

### Streamlit Deployment

Streamlit deployment will be added soon. Stay tuned for updates!
